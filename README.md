# TrainScheduler

This application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data of train names and times that a user inputs. The app retrieves and manipulates the train information with Moment.js. This website is designed to provide up-to-date information about various trains (as input by the user) particulary updating the table with the next train arrival times and how many minutes remain until each train arrives at the station.

 Note that the user can input the train data as requested in the "Add Train" form and the Current Train Listing is then updated based on the input data. The next train's arrival time and the minutes away are calculated based on the current time.

 For style, I kept it simple and clean so it keeps with the theme of my portfolio pages.
